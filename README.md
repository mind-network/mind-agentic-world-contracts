## Project Overview

AgenticWorld is a decentralized AI ecosystem designed to power secure and autonomous AI agents. Utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), it enables encrypted computations, ensuring robust data privacy within multi-agent systems (MAS). With integrated security layers and interoperability hubs, AgenticWorld facilitates trustless AI collaboration, decentralized identity management, and confidential machine learning across Web3 and DeFi ecosystems. As part of the AgenticWorld ecosystem, this project empowers users to own AI agents and interact with interoperability hubs. Through these interactions and staking mechanisms, users can participate in reward distribution, fostering engagement and incentivizing collaboration in the decentralized network.
